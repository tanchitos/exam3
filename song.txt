Through the gates of hell
As we make our way to heaven
Through the Nazi lines
Primo victoria

We've been training for years
Now we're ready to strike
As the great operation begins
We're the first wave on the shore
We're the first ones to fall
Yet soldiers have fallen before

In the dawn they will pay
With their lives as the price
History's written today
In this burning inferno
Know that nothing remains
As our forces advance on the beach

Aiming for heaven though serving in hell
Victory is ours their forces will fall

Through the gates of hell
As we make our way to heaven
Through the Nazi lines
Primo victoria
On the 6th of June
On the shores of western Europe 1944
D-day upon us

We've been here before
Used to this kind of war
Crossfire grind through the sand
Our orders were easy
It's kill or be killed
Blood on both sides will be spilled

In the dawn they will pay
With their lives as the price
History's written today
Now that we are at war
With the axis again
This time we know what will come

6th of June 1944
Allies are turning the war
Normandy state of anarchy
Overlord
2. Reign Of Terror

The sky is on fire burning black gold
Eyes of the west turn to east
Driven by greed and an urge to destroy
Merciless killing your own

Slave to the power a slave to the gold
Ruthlessly ruling the east
Your reing of terror must come to an end
Fighting your unholy war

[Pre-chorus:]
Now you will pay we'll charge you our way
Sooner or later we'll get you
Don't try to hide in your holes underground
Just like an insect we'll smoke you right out
[Chorus:]
Night time primetime
Ancient legacy of crime
One day we will make you pay for

Night time primetime
Law and order pays the fine
Genocide you cannot justify

Chaos in east disorder in west
Desert storm is a go
Fighters are launched from the carriers at sea
Infantry coming your way

Armoured brigades engaging their lines
Regain control of black gold
Your reign of terror will come to an end
Forcing you out of control

Countdown to death we're coming for you
Making our way through the desert
Soon you will pay for the pain that you caused
Captured or dead you will cause no more
Harm
